# Sales-Meeting-Mockup
This semi-functional mockup was presented to a Perfection Learning LLC sales team. I helped to author some of the angular code and fixed bugs in the code before the meeting. We used gulp to compile and share our files, so that's why you'll find gulp inside the project.
Specifically, I worked on the graphics of the class statistics and the layout of certain pages.
